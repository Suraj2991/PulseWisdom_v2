PulseWisdom is an astrological insights application that provides personalized recommendations based on planetary movements and alignments. The application helps users make decisions in harmony with universal energies through birth chart analysis and real-time planetary insights.

## Current Status (March 25, 2024)

### âœ… Implemented
- Backend core calculation engine
- MongoDB and Redis integration
- GraphQL API with WebSocket support
- Basic authentication system
- Essential astrological calculations
  - Planetary positions
  - House systems (Placidus & Equal)
  - Major aspects
  - Transit detection

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Backend test coverage expansion
- API documentation
- Performance optimization
- Error handling improvements

### ðŸ“‹ To Start
- Frontend implementation
- Birth chart visualization
- User interface development

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Yarn package manager
- MongoDB (local instance)
- Redis (local instance)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd PulseWisdom_v2
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
yarn install
```

3. **Environment Setup**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` with your local settings:
```env
# MongoDB
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/pulsewisdom

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# Server
PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=development

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

4. **Start Development Servers**
```bash
# Start all services
yarn dev

# Or start individual services
yarn dev:backend  # Start backend only
yarn dev:web     # Start web frontend (not implemented yet)
yarn dev:mobile  # Start mobile app (not implemented yet)
```

5. **Run Tests**
```bash
yarn test        # Run all tests
yarn test:backend # Run backend tests only
```
