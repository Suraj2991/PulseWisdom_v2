💸 Altara Monetization Strategy v1
🎯 Target
50,000 paying users at $11.11/month within 5 months of launch
~ $555,500 MRR by Month 5

🧱 Core Principles
Lead with value — don’t sell “astrology,” sell alignment, timing, clarity.

Let them feel the shift — emotionally and practically — before asking for payment.

Price in tune with the brand — $11.11 is not just spiritual, it’s ownable.

Make premium feel inevitable, not optional — like the full version of you is behind the veil.
