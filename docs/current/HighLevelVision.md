💫 User Journey Example

Meet Sara — 28, in a career rut, unsure about her relationship. She downloads PulseWisdom.

She inputs birth data. Her natal blueprint reveals a strong Capricorn Midheaven and Venus square Saturn.

She learns her struggle with self-worth affects love and ambition.

The AI alerts her: “Your Saturn Return just started—expect restructuring. Here’s how to work with it.”
