# Security Architecture

## Overview
PulseWisdom implements a comprehensive security architecture to protect user data and ensure secure access to astrological calculations and insights.

## Authentication System

### JWT Implementation
- Tokens are signed with a secure secret key
- Token expiration: 24 hours
- Refresh token mechanism for extended sessions
- Secure token storage in HTTP-only cookies

### Password Security
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds of 12
- Minimum password length: 8 characters
- Password complexity requirements enforced
- Secure password change mechanism

## Rate Limiting

### Authentication Endpoints
- 5 requests per 15-minute window per IP
- Standard rate limit headers
- Clear error messages for rate limit exceeded

### API Endpoints
- 100 requests per 15-minute window per IP
- Rate limit information in response headers
- Graceful degradation under load

## Input Validation

### Request Validation
- Zod schema validation for all endpoints
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Sanitization of user inputs
- Validation error messages

### Data Sanitization
- HTML escaping
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection

## Error Handling

### Security Errors
- Generic error messages for security-related failures
- Detailed logging for security events
- Rate limit exceeded notifications
- Authentication failure tracking

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "string",
  "details": [
    {
      "field": "string",
      "message": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Security Headers

### HTTP Headers
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Events
- Authentication attempts
- Password changes
- Rate limit exceeded
- Invalid token attempts
- Suspicious activity detection

### Logging Standards
- Timestamp
- IP address
- User ID (if authenticated)
- Event type
- Event details
- Severity level

## Best Practices

### Development Guidelines
- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code review requirements
- Security testing in CI/CD pipeline

### Deployment Security
- Environment variable management
- Secret rotation
- Regular security updates
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- User data encryption at rest
- Secure data transmission
- Data retention policies
- User consent management

### Privacy
- GDPR compliance
- Data minimization
- User rights enforcement
- Privacy policy adherence
