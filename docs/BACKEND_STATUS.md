## Summary

### Completed Items
- Basic service structures
- API endpoint planning
- Architecture documentation
- Code style guidelines
- Testing structure

### Pending Items
- Infrastructure setup
- Service implementation
- Security implementation
- Testing implementation
- Documentation completion
- Deployment setup
- Feature implementation

## Next Steps
1. Set up core infrastructure (MongoDB, Redis)
2. Implement authentication service
3. Complete core service implementations
4. Set up testing framework
5. Implement security measures
6. Complete documentation
7. Set up deployment pipeline
8. Implement user features

## Notes
- All core services have their structure defined but need implementation
- Security and testing are critical areas that need immediate attention
- Documentation needs to be completed alongside implementation
- Infrastructure setup is a prerequisite for other implementations
