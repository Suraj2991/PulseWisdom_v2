# Development Log

## March 25, 2024

### Changes Made
1. **Type System Improvements**
   - Fixed DateTime type issues in EphemerisCalculatorSingleton tests
   - Updated mock data structure to match expected types
   - Fixed type mismatches in PlanetaryInsightService tests
   - Corrected aspect and body position type definitions

2. **Test Suite Enhancements**
   - Fixed constructor access in MockEphemerisCalculator
   - Added proper calculator variable declarations in test cases
   - Updated mock data structure for birth chart calculations
   - Improved test assertions for type safety

3. **Service Implementation**
   - Verified getBirthChart method in PlanetaryInsightService
   - Ensured proper type handling in service methods
   - Fixed type conversion issues in mock data
   - Improved error handling in test cases

### Pending Issues
1. **Type System**
   - Need to ensure consistent type usage across all services
   - Need to verify type safety in all mock data
   - Need to update type definitions in shared packages

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Need to add more edge cases for type conversions
   - Need to improve error handling test coverage
   - Need to add tests for concurrent operations

3. **Documentation**
   - Need to document type system changes
   - Need to update test documentation
   - Need to add examples for type usage

### Next Steps
1. Complete type system improvements
2. Enhance test coverage
3. Update documentation
4. Implement remaining service features

### Changes Made
1. Fixed test configuration issues:
   - Properly configured Jest projects for integration tests
   - Set up MongoDB memory server for testing
   - Configured Redis mock for testing
   - Added proper test timeouts

2. Fixed PlanetaryInsightService test issues:
   - Implemented proper mocking for EphemerisCalculator

### Pending Issues
1. Type Issues in PlanetaryInsightService tests:
   - Need to properly mock InsightType enum (currently using string literals)
   - Need to fix type mismatch in mock insight data:
     * interpretation should be Promise<string> instead of string
     * aspects should be Aspect[] instead of never[]
   - Need to ensure mock data matches expected types from the service

2. Test Coverage:
   - Need to add more test cases for edge cases
   - Need to improve error handling test coverage
   - Need to add tests for concurrent operations

3. Documentation:
   - Need to document test setup process
   - Need to add comments explaining mock data structure
   - Need to document common test patterns

### Next Steps
1. Fix InsightType enum mocking
2. Update mock data structure to match expected types
3. Add more comprehensive test cases
4. Improve test documentation 

## March 22, 2024 14:30 UTC - Test Suite Improvements

### Recent Changes
1. Fixed MongoDB test setup in `apps/backend/src/__tests__/setup.ts`:
   - Added proper MongoDB memory server configuration
   - Implemented proper connection handling with error logging
   - Added cleanup in afterAll to close connections
   - Added proper collection clearing between tests

2. Improved test configuration in `apps/backend/jest.config.ts`:
   - Added integration test project configuration
   - Set test timeout to 30000ms
   - Added proper environment variables for testing
   - Configured test file patterns and coverage settings

3. Enhanced test data in `apps/backend/src/__tests__/services/PlanetaryInsightService.test.ts`:
   - Added mockBirthChart with Sun and Moon positions
   - Created createMockInsight helper function
   - Added proper mock data structure for insights
   - Implemented proper mocking for EphemerisCalculator

4. Fixed service tests:
   - Updated `apps/backend/src/__tests__/services/BirthChartService.test.ts`:
     * Added validation tests for invalid coordinates
     * Fixed mock implementations for model methods
     * Improved test assertions
   - Enhanced `apps/backend/src/__tests__/services/PlanetaryInsightService.test.ts`:
     * Added proper model method mocking
     * Implemented test cases for CRUD operations
     * Added error handling test cases

### Current Issues
1. PlanetaryInsightService test failures in `apps/backend/src/__tests__/services/PlanetaryInsightService.test.ts`:
   - Type issues with InsightType enum (needs proper enum import)
   - Mock data type mismatches:
     * interpretation should be Promise<string> instead of string
     * aspects should be Aspect[] instead of never[]
   - Mongoose model mocking needs improvement:
     * findByIdAndUpdate not properly handling null cases
     * findByIdAndDelete not properly handling null cases

2. Test Coverage:
   - Missing edge cases in service tests
   - Error handling scenarios need more coverage
   - Integration tests need more comprehensive data

### Next Steps
1. Fix type issues in PlanetaryInsightService tests:
   - Import proper InsightType enum from types package
   - Update mock data structure to match expected types
   - Fix Mongoose model mocking with proper type assertions

2. Improve test coverage:
   - Add more edge cases to service tests
   - Enhance error handling test coverage
   - Add more comprehensive integration tests

3. Documentation:
   - Update test documentation in README.md
   - Add more examples in test files
   - Document test data structure in comments
