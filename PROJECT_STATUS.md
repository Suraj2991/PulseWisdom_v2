# PulseWisdom Project Status

## Project Overview
- Astrological analysis and insight generation platform
- Built with TypeScript/Node.js backend and React frontend
- Focus on accurate astronomical calculations and meaningful astrological interpretations

## Completed Tasks
1. Core Services Implementation
   - BirthChartService: Basic birth chart calculations and storage
   - TransitService: Transit calculations and analysis
   - InsightService: Astrological insight generation
   - UserService: User management and preferences

2. Test Coverage
   - Comprehensive tests for all core services
   - Mock implementations for external dependencies
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - Type safety and validation

3. Data Models
   - User model with preference system
   - BirthChart model with astronomical data
   - Insight and Transit analysis models

## Current Status
- Core services are implemented and tested
- Basic user management is in place
- Preference system is implemented and validated
- Test coverage is comprehensive for existing features

## Next Steps
1. Frontend Implementation
   - User interface for birth chart input
   - Visualization of astrological charts
   - Display of insights and transits

2. Additional Features
   - Authentication system
   - Email notifications
   - Advanced chart calculations
   - More detailed astrological interpretations

3. Integration
   - API endpoints
   - Frontend-backend integration
   - Real-time updates

## Key Decisions Made
1. Architecture
   - Service-based architecture
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Redis for caching
   - Mongoose for data persistence

2. Testing Strategy
   - Comprehensive unit tests
   - Mock-based testing
   - Type-safe test data
   - Clear test organization

3. Data Models
   - Flexible preference system
   - Structured astrological data
   - Clear separation of concerns

## Patterns & Conventions
1. Code Organization
   - Service-based structure
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Type-first approach

2. Testing Patterns
   - Mock-based testing
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Clear test categorization
   - Type-safe test data

3. Error Handling
   - Custom error types
   - Consistent error patterns
   - Proper error propagation

## Notes
- All core services are implemented and tested
- Focus on type safety and validation
- Ready for frontend integration
- Need to implement authentication and notifications
